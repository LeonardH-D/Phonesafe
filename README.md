# Phonesafe
As many of us I have a (slight) smartphone addiction. To make it easier to withstand the distraction of it in lectures and working I designed this safe which is timer controlled and locks away your phone to get in the flow. 

A instructables with detailed building instructions will follow soon.

The code is written in the arduino IDE and still in beta. 

The box for the smartphone can be adjusted with Fusion 360 as the files are included. The attatched box is for an iPhone 15 Pro with a Mous Intralock case. 

The PCB ist Version 2. Version 2.1 with includes an external crystal for RTC will be uploaded soon. It will have the same dimensions as V2. 

The components are listed in the BOM. I sourced them in Germany at Reichelt and in China on Aliexpress. But all (exept the charging module) are pretty universally available, that should be no problem. Soldering is pretty straigth forward as is flashing the ESP. 

I hope you enjoy it and it helps you collect some phone free hours (maybe even days) :)
